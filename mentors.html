        sales by finding overlooked opportunities and customizing the sales 
        process to be more effective. I have worked with companies like Google, 
        Sprint, Aflac, Toyota, GM, Ford, and thousands more. I own and operate seven 
        companies that do almost $100 million in annual sales and I’m also a 
        New York Times bestselling author, international speaker,
